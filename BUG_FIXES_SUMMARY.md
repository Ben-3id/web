# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the Islamic website codebase.

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Script Loading Order Issues âœ…
**Problem**: Scripts were loading before DOM elements were available
- `home.html` was loading scripts in `<head>` before DOM elements existed
- `data.js` was executing immediately without waiting for DOM ready

**Solution**: 
- Moved script loading to end of `<body>` 
- Added `DOMContentLoaded` event listener in `data.js`
- Used `type="module"` for proper ES6 module loading

### 2. Missing DOM Elements âœ…
**Problem**: `script.js` referenced `categoriesGrid` element that didn't exist
- Script was trying to access non-existent DOM element
- Caused JavaScript errors and prevented functionality

**Solution**:
- Removed references to non-existent `categoriesGrid`
- Added proper null checks for DOM elements
- Simplified script to only handle existing elements

### 3. Incorrect File Paths âœ…
**Problem**: Wrong relative paths in navigation links
- `data.js` used `../pages/section.html` from home page (should be `pages/section.html`)
- Caused 404 errors when clicking category cards

**Solution**:
- Fixed relative path to `pages/section.html` in `data.js`
- Verified all other file paths are correct

### 4. Inconsistent Module Loading âœ…
**Problem**: Mixed module and non-module script loading
- Some files used ES6 imports, others used regular script tags
- Some used Skypack CDN, others used different CDNs
- Caused module loading conflicts

**Solution**:
- Standardized all scripts to use `type="module"`
- Unified all Sanity client imports to use Skypack CDN
- Removed redundant script tags

### 5. Duplicate Functionality âœ…
**Problem**: Both `script.js` and `data.js` were trying to load categories
- Caused conflicts and redundant API calls
- Made code maintenance difficult

**Solution**:
- Removed category loading from `script.js`
- Made `data.js` the single source for home page category loading
- Simplified `script.js` to only handle sections (for other pages)

### 6. Missing Error Handling âœ…
**Problem**: Scripts didn't handle missing DOM elements gracefully
- Would throw errors if elements weren't found
- No user-friendly error messages

**Solution**:
- Added null checks for all DOM element access
- Added try-catch blocks around critical operations
- Provided user-friendly error messages

### 7. Undefined Variable References âœ…
**Problem**: `topic-script.js` referenced undefined `islamicData` variable
- Script would fail with ReferenceError
- Topic pages wouldn't load

**Solution**:
- Added Sanity client import to `topic-script.js`
- Added proper error message for under-development features
- Prepared structure for future Sanity schema implementation

### 8. Incorrect Script References âœ…
**Problem**: Some HTML files had incorrect script references
- `test.html` referenced non-existent `data.js` file
- Some scripts weren't loaded as modules

**Solution**:
- Fixed all script references to use correct paths
- Updated `test.html` to work with new Sanity-based structure
- Standardized all script loading to use modules

## Files Modified

### HTML Files:
- `home.html` - Fixed script loading order
- `pages/article.html` - Removed redundant Sanity script tag
- `pages/topic.html` - Fixed script loading to use modules
- `pages/debug.html` - Updated to use module loading
- `pages/contact.html` - Updated to use module loading
- `pages/test.html` - Complete rewrite to test Sanity connection

### JavaScript Files:
- `data/data.js` - Added DOM ready handling, fixed paths
- `js/script.js` - Removed duplicate functionality, added error handling
- `js/topic-script.js` - Added Sanity client, fixed undefined variable issue

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Home Page**: Verify categories load from Sanity
2. **Section Pages**: Test navigation from home to section pages
3. **Article Pages**: Test article loading with both ID and slug parameters
4. **Contact Page**: Verify form functionality
5. **Test Page**: Use `pages/test.html` to verify Sanity connection

## Notes

- All scripts now use consistent ES6 module loading
- Error handling is improved throughout the codebase
- File paths are corrected and verified
- The website now has a more robust and maintainable structure

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper section/topic schema in Sanity for topic pages
2. Add loading states for better user experience
3. Implement proper form submission backend for contact page
4. Add more comprehensive error logging
